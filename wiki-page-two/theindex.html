 <p> </p> <b>Graphic design</b> is a <a href="#section1">profession<sup>[2]</sup> </a>,
 <a href="#section1">academic discipline<sup>[3][4][5]</sup> </a> and 
 <a href="#section1">applied art</a> whose activity consists in projecting <a href="#section1">visual 
  communications</a> intended to transmit specific messages to social groups, 
 with specific objectives.<sup>[6]</sup> Graphic design is an interdisciplinary branch 
 of <a href="#section1">design<sup>[1]</sup> </a> and of the <a href="#section1">fine arts</a>. Its practice involves <a href="#section1">creativity, innovation</a>
  and     <a href="#section1">lateral thinking</a>using manual or  <a href="#section1">digital tools</a>, where it is usual to use 
  text and graphics to communicate visually.

    The role of the <a href="#section1">graphic designer</a> in the communication 
    process is that of encoder or interpreter of the message. 
    They work on the interpretation, ordering, and presentation 
    of visual messages. Usually, graphic design uses the     <a href="#section1"> aesthetics </a>
    of  <a href="#section1">typography</a> and the compositional arrangement of the text, 
    ornamentation, and imagery to convey ideas, feelings, and attitudes 
    beyond what language alone expresses. The design work can be based on 
    a customer's demand, a demand that ends up being established linguistically, 
    either orally or in writing, that is, that graphic design transforms a linguistic
     message into a graphic manifestation.<a href="#section1"><sup>[7]</sup> </a>
  </p>

  <p>
    Graphic design has, as a field of application, 
    different areas of knowledge focused on any visual 
    communication system. For example, it can be applied in advertising 
    strategies, or it can also be applied in the    <a href="#section1"> aviation</a>
     world <a href="#section1"> <sup>[8]</sup></a> or 
     <a href="#section1"> pace exploration.<sup>[9][10]</sup> </a> In this sense, in some countries graphic
     design is related as only associated with the production of sketches
      and drawings, this is incorrect, since visual communication is a 
      small part of a huge range of types and classes where it can be 
      applied.
  </p>

   <p>
    With origins in <a href="#section1"> Antiquity  </a> and the   <a href="#section1"> Middle Ages,<sup>[11]</sup> </a>
    graphic design as applied art was initially linked to the boom 
    of <a href="#section1"> rise of printing </a>  in Europe in the 15th century and the growth of 
    consumer culture in the Industrial Revolution. From there it emerged 
    as a distinct profession in the West, closely associated with 
    <a href="#section1">  advertising </a>in the 19th century<sup>[12]</sup>and its evolution allowed its 
    consolidation in the 20th century. Given the rapid and massive growth 
    in information exchange today, the demand for experienced designers 
    is greater than ever, particularly because of the development of new 
    technologies and the need to pay attention to human factors beyond 
    the competence of the engineers who develop them.<sup>[13]</sup>

  In 1917,  <a href="#section1">Frederick H. Meyer</a>, director and instructor at 
  the <a href="#section1"> California School of Arts and Crafts</a>, taught a class entitled
   "Graphic Design and Lettering".<sup>[25]</sup> Raffe's Graphic Design, published
    in 1927, was the first book to use "Graphic Design" in its title. <sup>[26] </sup>
    In 1936, author and graphic designer Leon Friend published his book 
    titled "Graphic Design" and it is known to be the first piece of 
    literature to cover the topic extensively.<sup>[27]</sup>

  The signage in the<a href="#section1"> London Underground</a> is a classic design example <sup>[28]</sup> of the 
  <a href="#section1"> modern era</a>. 
  Although he lacked artistic training,   <a href="#section1"> Frank Pick </a> led the Underground Group design and publicity movement. The first Underground station 
  signs were introduced in 1908 with a design of a solid red disk with a blue bar in the center and the name of the station. The station 
  name was in white sans-serif letters. It was in 1916 when Pick used the expertise of  <a href="#section1"> Edward Johnston</a> to design a new typeface for the Underground. 
  Johnston redesigned the Underground sign and logo to include his 
  typeface on the blue bar in the center of a red circle. <sup>[29]</sup>

  The cyan forms, the US flag, presidential seal and the Caslon lettering, 
  were all designed at different times, by different designers, for different purposes, 
  and combined by designer Raymond Loewy in this one single aircraft exterior design.

    Graphic design can have many applications, 
    from <a href="#section1">road signs</a> to technical schematics and reference   <a href="#section1">manuals</a>. 
    It is often used in branding products and elements of company 
    identity such as logos, colors,   <a href="#section1">  packaging, labelling</a> and text.

From scientific journals to news reporting, the presentation 
of opinion and facts is often improved with graphics and thoughtful 
compositions of visual information â€“ known as <a href="#section1">  information design</a>. With 
the advent of the web, information designers with experience in 
interactive tools are increasingly used to illustrate the background to 
news stories. Information design can include <a href="#section1"> data and information 
  visualization</a>, which involves using programs to interpret and form 
data into a visually compelling presentation, and can be tied in with 
<a href="#section1"> information graphics</a>.

  A graphic design project may involve the creative presentation of 
  existing <a href="#section1"> text</a>, ornament, and images.

The "process school" is concerned with communication; it highlights the
 channels and media through which messages are transmitted and by which 
 senders and receivers encode and decode these messages. 
 The semiotic school treats a message as a construction of signs
  which through interaction with receivers, produces meaning; 
  communication as an agent.   <a href="#section1"> <sup>[citation needed]</sup></a>
