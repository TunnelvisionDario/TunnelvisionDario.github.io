            <p>
                I aspire to be designing covers such as music, events, magazines, etc. I live in the state of Massachusetts planning to move out of state. I'm not sure exactly yet where. I've learned many skills at First Institute that I can implement in the real world or even my own projects. I also use resources such as YouTube and Skillshare.com with a yearly subscription so I can learn and perfect my skills in graphic design.

                I also have my own clothing brand I am currently building. I'm working with manufacturers overseas to do samples with a variety of fabrics that I find quality and visually appealing, aligning with the style that I envision. My ultimate goal is to build my clothing brand, manage all the marketing and advertising I need. I also know my niche. I aspire to have a sneaker line one day, kind of like Jordans. I am starting as a clothing brand first. Once it comes to life, when it is successful, we will start collaborating with designers to help improve our designs. I believe having a strong team is essential, so I am using all the resources I can to make these aspirations come to life.
