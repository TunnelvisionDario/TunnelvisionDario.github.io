        <p>Brief bio/description of the Siberian Husky.</p>
    </div>The Siberian Husky, a medium-sized dog breed, originated in northern Siberia. The Chukchi originally bred them as sled-dogs and later imported to Alaska for sled dog races in the early 1900s.

    Siberian Huskies are characterized by a thick, distinctive coat, which can be either white, black or gray. They also have distinct markings on the face. The Siberian Huskies are well-known for their outgoing and friendly personalities. They love being around people. They can also be difficult to train and stubborn if they are not socialized from an early age.
