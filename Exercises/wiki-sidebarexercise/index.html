                <h2>Forests</h2>
                <img src="images/forest.jpg" alt="Forests">
                <p>Forests are the Earth's lungs, playing an invaluable 
                    role in mitigating climate change. 
                    They are the most biodiverse ecosystems on land, 
                    home to more than 80% of the terrestrial species of 
                    animals, plants, and insects. Covering about 31% of 
                    the global land area, forests also provide shelter, 
                    jobs, security, and cultural relevance for many 
                    indigenous and local communities around the world. 
                    There are various types of forests: tropical 
                    rainforests, temperate forests, and boreal forests 
                    being the primary ones. Each of these forest types 
                    has its unique flora and fauna. They act as carbon 
                    sinks, absorbing roughly 2 billion tonnes of carbon 
                    dioxide every year.</p>

                <h2>Mountains</h2>
                <img src="images/mountain.jpg" alt="Mountains">
                <p>Mountains are majestic elevations that rise abruptly 
                    from the surrounding environment and have peaks 
                    narrower than their base. They are formed through 
                    tectonic forces or volcanism. Covering about 22% of 
                    the Earth's land surface, mountains play a critical 
                    role in providing freshwater to billions of people, 
                    acting as a biodiversity hub and offering a place 
                    for tourism and spiritual contemplation. 
                    They are also the sources of most of the rivers 
                    around the world. Mountain ecosystems are sensitive 
                    to climate change, and global warming could bring 
                    some substantial adverse effects on them.</p>

            <section id="oceans">
                <h2>Oceans</h2>
                <img src="images/ocean.jpg" alt="Oceans">
                <p>Oceans are vast bodies of saltwater that cover more than 70% of the Earth's surface. They play a fundamental role in regulating the Earth's climate and are home to numerous species of marine flora and fauna. From the shallows of the coral reefs to the abyssal depths, oceans are a reservoir of immense biodiversity. They also act as the world's largest carbon sink, playing a pivotal role in climate regulation. Oceans also support the livelihood of millions of people, from fishing to tourism, and hold a deep cultural significance for many coastal communities.</p>

            <section id="deserts">
                <h2>Deserts</h2>
                <img src="images/desert.png" alt="Deserts">
                <p>Deserts are natural landscapes that receive very 
                    little annual rainfall, leading to harsh living 
                    conditions. They can be hot deserts, like the Sahara 
                    or the Arabian desert, or cold deserts like the Gobi 
                    or the Great Basin. While they may seem lifeless 
                    at first glance, deserts are home to a myriad of 
                    adapted plants and animals. The flora and fauna here 
                    have unique adaptations that allow them to survive 
                    the extreme temperatures and conditions. 
                    Interestingly, the largest solar power plant in 
                    the world is located in a desert, harnessing 
                    the sun's energy.</p>
